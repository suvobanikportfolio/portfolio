    "Description": "Bridging Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning with nanoscale modeling, such as molecular dynamics or density functional theory, can expedite materials discovery across different spatiotemporal scales. RL (Reinforcement Learning)-driven decision trees are effective in exploring complex materials landscapes. This portion of my work dedicates to utilizing these decision trees for the development of autonomous workflows for predicting new phases of materials or tailoring the properties of existing ones.",
